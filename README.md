Tic-Tac-Toe game for learning module pattern and encapsulation
Surprisingly tricky task because of the factories and module patterns.
In a way not THAT dissimal to normal classes and objects, but definitely dissimilar enough to trip me up.
The lack of setters was tricky. 
I was often finding it hard to get my head around exactly how to "feed" information into the application without setters.

Lessons learned are pretty much those from Java, just keep everything cleanly separated and then link using exported functions.
Probably going to be mostly using classes in JS from now on though, because this was confusing and not very similar to any other programming language I know.
